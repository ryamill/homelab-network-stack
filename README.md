  ## Overview
  The homelab-network-stack repository serves as a centralised and version-controlled source for all aspects of my home network. My goal is to maintain a robust, secure, and highly available network that supports various homelab services, including virtualisation, container orchestration, media servers, and general home automation. This documentation aims to provide a clear understanding of the network's design and implementation.

  * TBA

  ### Agent:
  * I have built an agent to support network troubleshooting, the agent is powered by the comprehensive information within this repository (homelab-network-stack), designed to provide insights and assistance related to its configuration and operation. The underlying prompts and logic for this agent can be found in the ./agent directory of this repository.

  ## Configuration Structure
  
  This repository is organised to logically separate different aspects of the network configuration:

  * **./firewall/:** Firewall rules, NAT configurations, and general router settings.
  * **./networking/:** VLAN definitions, IP addressing schemes, and switch configurations.
  * **./dns/:** DNS records, Pi-hole configurations, and custom host entries.
  * **./vpn/:** VPN server and client configurations.
  * **./ansible/:** Ansible playbooks for automating server and service deployments.
  * **./terraform/:** Terraform configurations for infrastructure as code.
  * **./docs/:** Additional documentation, notes, and troubleshooting guides.
  * **./diagrams/:** Network topology diagrams (logical and physical).
  * **./agent/:** Prompts for agentic home network specialist.

  Detailed network diagrams will be included in the ./diagrams/ directory. These will illustrate:

  * Logical Network Diagram: Showing VLANs, subnets, and routing paths.
  * Physical Network Diagram: Depicting hardware connections and cable runs.
  * Service Flow Diagram: Illustrating how different services interact across the network.
